BINNING USES

1.HISTOGRAM ANALYSIS:

Binning is used to create histograms, which help in understanding the distribution of continuous data. Histograms provide a visual summary of the 
underlying frequency distribution of a set of continuous data points.

2.REDUCING DATA COMPLEXITY:

Binning reduces the complexity of data by converting continuous variables into a smaller number of discrete categories. This makes the data easier to 
handle and analyze, especially in scenarios with large datasets.

3.DATA SMOOTHING:

Binning helps in smoothing data by reducing the effect of minor observation variations. This is particularly useful in time series data analysis, where 
bins can represent aggregate values over specified time periods.

4.ENHANCING DECISION TREES:

Decision tree algorithms benefit from binning because it can reduce the number of splits and thus simplify the model. Binned features can lead to more 
stable and interpretable trees.

5.SEGMENTATION:

Binning is used in market segmentation to group customers based on continuous variables like age, income, or purchase frequency. This helps in identifying 
and targeting specific customer groups.
