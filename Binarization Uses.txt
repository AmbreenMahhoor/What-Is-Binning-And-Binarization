Binarization

Feature Engineering:

Binarization transforms continuous or categorical variables into binary features, making them suitable for algorithms that require binary input, such as logistic regression and support vector machines (SVM).

Threshold-based Decision Making:

In healthcare, binarization can be used to convert continuous measurements (e.g., blood pressure, glucose levels) into binary indicators of normal vs. abnormal ranges, facilitating clinical decision-making.

One-Hot Encoding:

One-hot encoding, a type of binarization, converts categorical variables into a binary matrix. This is essential for machine learning algorithms that cannot handle categorical data directly.

Indicator Variables:

Binarization is used to create indicator variables that signal the presence or absence of a condition. For example, in fraud detection, binary features can indicate whether a transaction meets certain risk criteria.

Simplifying Data Interpretation:

Binarizing data can make it easier to interpret and visualize. For instance, converting a continuous variable to a binary form can help in creating clear and straightforward plots.
